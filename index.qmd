**This is my personal learning material and is therefore neither a
scientific peer reviewed article nor an authoritative textbook.**

With this book I want to apply my statistical knowledge using the R
language to investigate social inequality for Austria, my country of
birth and where I am living.

I am writing this book as a text for others to read because that forces
me to become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more
carefully.

Please keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a
learner.

## Glossary {.unnumbered}

I am using the {**glossary**} package to create links to glossary
entries.\]

library(glossary)

## If you want to use my glossary.yml file:

## 1. fork my repo
##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb

## 2. Download the `glossary.yml` file from
##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml)

## 3. Store the file on your hard disk
##    and change the following path accordingly

glossary::glossary_path("../glossary-pb/glossary.yml")

```
:::
:::

If you hover with your mouse over the double underlined links it opens
an window with the appropriate glossary text. Try this example:
`r glossary("Z-Score")`.

To apply the glossary into this text I have used the {**glossary**}
package by [Lisa
DeBruine](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/index.html).

There is no guarantee that the glossary text -- as well as
the whole book -- contains correct information. Whenever possible I have
mentioned the source of the glossary entry. (You will find active
links to the source in the original glossary file at
[GitHub](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml))<br /><br />
Sometimes I have used abbreviation for the source, but I need
still to provide a key what this short references mean.

:::
:::

If you fork the [repository of this quarto
book](https://github.com/petzi53/inequality-austria) then the glossary
will not work out of the box. Load down the `glossary.yml` file from [my
glossary-pb GitHub
repo](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml),
store it on your hard disk and change the path in the code chunk
@lst-preface-load-glossary.

In any case I am the only responsible person for this text.

## R Code {.unnumbered}

For R code I am using mainly the [Tidyverse Style
Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) with some additions from [Google’s
R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html). These
additons are:

-   Start the names of private functions with a dot.
-   Don't use `base::attach()`.
-   No right-hand assignments.
-   Qualify namespace.

Especially the last point (qualifying namespace) is important for my
learning. Besides preventing conflicts with functions of identical names
from different packages it helps me to learn (or remember) which
function belongs to which package. I think this justifies the small
overhead and helps to make R code chunks self-sufficient. (No previous
package loading, or library calls in the setup chunk.) To foster
learning the relation between function and package I embrace the package
name with curly brakes and format it in bold. Additionally I will add a
special annex file "Used packages" with an alphabetically sorted list of
short package descriptions.

I am mentioning package name explicitly also for the default
installation of base R. This wouldn't be necessary but it helps me to
understand where the base R functions come from. What follows is a list
of base R packages of the system library included into every
installation and attached (opened) by default:

-   {**base**}: The R Base Package
-   {**datsets**}: The R Datasets Package
-   {**graphics**}: The R Graphics Package
-   {**grDevices**}: The R Graphics Devices and Support for Colours and
    Fonts
-   {**methods**}: Formal Methods and Classes
-   {**stats**}: The R Stats Package
-   {**utils**}: The R Utils Package

But I will not always mention the name of the argument inside a
function. When it is clear then I will follow the advice from Hadley
Wickham: 

> When you call a function, you typically omit the names of data arguments, because they are used so commonly. If you overridethe default value of an argument, use the full name ([tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html)).

-   `variable`: the variable code to which the metadata refer.
-   `age`: the code of the age group to which the population refer.
-   `pop`: the code of the population unit to which the population
    refer.
-   `countryname`: the name of the country/region as it would appear in
    an English sentence.
-   `shortname`: the name of the country/region as it would appear on
    its own in English.
-   `simpledes`: decription of the variable in plain English.
-   `technicaldes`: description of the variable via accounting
    identities.

    for details.

## How interpreting the data codes?

### Variable codes {#sec-chap0-variable-codes}

The meaning of each variable is described in the metadata files. The
complete WID variable codes (i.e. sptinc992j) obey to the following
logic:

-   the first letter indicates the variable type (i.e. "s" for share).
-   the next five letters indicate the income/wealth/other concept (i.e.
    "ptinc" for pre-tax national income).
-   the next three digits indicate the age group (i.e. "992" for
    adults).
-   the last letter indicate the population unit (i.e. "j" for
    equal-split).

### Percentile Codes {#sec-chap0-percentile-codes}

There are two types of percentiles on WID.world : (1) group percentiles
and (2) generalized percentiles. The interpretation of income (or
wealth) average, share or threshold series depends on which type of
percentile is looked at.

#### Group Percentiles

Group percentiles are defined as follows:

**Bottom and top**

-   p0p50 (bottom 50% of the population),
-   p50p90 (next 40%),
-   p90p100 (top 10%),
-   p99p100 (top 1%),
-   p0p90 (bottom 90%),
-   p0p99 (bottom 99% of the population),
-   p99.9p100 (top 0.1%),
-   p99.99p100 (top 0.01%)

**Deciles**

-   p0p10 (bottom 10% of the population, i.e. first decile),
-   p10p20 (next 10%, i.e. second decile),
-   p20p30 (next 10%, i.e. third decile),
-   p30p40 (next 10%, i.e. fourth decile),
-   p40p50 (next 10%, i.e. fifth decile),
-   p50p60 (next 10%, i.e. sixth decile),
-   p60p70 (next 10%, i.e. seventh decile),
-   p70p80 (next 10%, i.e. eighth decile),
-   p80p90 (next 10%, i.e. ninth decile),

For each group percentiles, we provide the associated income or wealth
shares, averages and thresholds.

-   **group percentile shares** correspond to the income (or wealth)
    share held by a given group percentile. For instance, the
    fiscal income share of group p0p50 is the share of total fiscal
    income captured by the bottom 50% group.
-   **group percentile averages** correspond to the income or wealth
    annual income (or wealth) average within a given group percentile
    group. For instance, the fiscal income average of group p0p50 is the
    average annual fiscal income of the bottom 50% group.
-   **group percentile thresholds** correspond to the minimum income (or
    wealth) level required to belong to a given group percentile. For
    instance, the fiscal income threshold of group p90p100 is the
    minimum annual fiscal income required to belong to the top 10%
    group.

::: {#imp-group-percentiles .callout-important}
When the data allows, the [WID.world website](https://wid.world/) makes
it possible to produce shares, averages and thresholds for any group
percentile (say, for instance, average income of p43p99.92). These are
not stored in bulk data tables.
:::

For certain countries, because of data limitations, we are not able to
provide the list of group percentiles described above. We instead store
specific group percentiles (these can be, depending on the countries
p90p95, p95p100, p95p99, p99.5p100, p99.5p99.9, p99.75p100, p99.95p100,
p99.95p99.99, p99.995p100, p99.9p99.95, p99.9p99.99 or p99p99.5).

#### Generalized Percentiles

Generalized percentiles (g-percentiles) are defined to as follows: p0,
p1, p2, ..., p99, p99.1, p99.2, ..., p99.9, p99.91, p99.92, ..., p99.99,
p99.991, p99.992 ,..., p99.999. There are 127 g-percentiles in total.

For each g-percentiles, we provide shares, averages, top averages and
thresholds.

**g-percentile shares**

correspond to the income (or wealth) share captured by the population
group above a given g-percentile value.

::: {#nte-g-percentile-shares .callout-note style="color: blue;"}
##### Examples for g-percentile shares

-   The fiscal income share of g-percentile p90 corresponds to the
    fiscal income share held by the top 10% group.
-   The fiscal income share of g-percentile p99.9 corresponds to the
    fiscal income share of the top 0.1% income group and so on.

By construction, the fiscal income share of g-percentile p0 corresponds
to the share held by 100% of the population and is equal to 100%.
Formally, the g-percentile share at g-percentile pX corresponds to the
share of the top (100-X)% group.
:::

**g-percentile averages**

correspond to the average income or wealth between two consecutive
g-percentiles.

-   Average income of g-percentile `p0` corresponds to the average
    annual income of the bottom 1% group, `p2` corresponds to the next
    1% group and so on until `p98` (the 1% population group below the
    top 1%).
-   Average income of g-percentile `p99` corresponds to average annual
    of group percentile `p99p99.1` (i.e. the bottom 10% group of earners
    within the top 1% group of earners), `p99.1` corresponds to the next
    0.1% group, `p99.2` corresponds to the next 0.1% group and so on
    until `p99.8`.
-   Average income of `p99.9` corresponds to the average annual income
    of group percentile `p99.9p99.91` (i.e. the bottom 10% group of
    earners within the top 0.1% group of earners), `p99.91` corresponds
    to the next 0.01% group, `p99.92` corresponds to the next 0.01%
    group and so on until `p99.98`.
-   Average income of `p99.99`, corresponds to the average annual income
    of group percentile `p99.99p99.991` (i.e. the bottom 10% group
    within the top 0.01% group of earners), `p99.991` corresponds to the
    next 0.001%, `p99.992` corresponds to the next 0.001% group and so
    on until `p99.999` (average income of the top 0.001% group).

::: {#nte-examples-g-percentile-averages .callout-note style="color: blue;"}
##### Examples for the g-percentile-averages

-   The average fiscal income of g-percentile p50 is equal to the
    average annual fiscal income of the p50p51 group percentile (i.e.
    the average annual income of the population group earning more than
    50% of the population and less than the top 49% of the population).
-   The average fiscal income of g-percentile p99 is equal to the
    average annual fiscal income within group percentile p99p99.1 (i.e.
    a group representing 0.1% of the total population earning more than
    99% of the population but less than the top 0.9% of the population).
:::

**g-percentile top-averages**

correspond to the average income or wealth above a given g-percentile
threshold.

::: {#nte-examples-g-percentile-top-averages .callout-note style="color: blue;"}
##### Examples for the g-percentile-top-averages

-   The top average fiscal income at g-percentile p50 corresponds to the
    average annual fiscal income of individuals earning more than 50% of
    the population.
-   The top average fiscal income at g-percentile p90 corresponds to the
    average annual fiscal income of the top 10% group.
:::

**g-percentile thresholds**

correspond to minimum income (or wealth) level required to belong to the
population group above a given g-percentile value.

::: {#nte-examples-g-percentile-thresholds .callout-note style="color: blue;"}
##### Examples for the g-percentile-thresholds

-   The fiscal income threshold at g-percentile p90 corresponds to the
    minimum annual fiscal income required to belong to the top 10%
    group.
-   The fiscal income threshold at g-percentile p99.9 corresponds to the
    minimum annual fiscal income required to belong to the top 0.1%
    group.

Formally, the g-percentile threshold at g-percentile pX corresponds to
the threshold of the top (100-X)% group.
