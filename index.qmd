**This is my personal learning material and is therefore neither a
scientific peer reviewed article nor an authoritative textbook.**

With this book I want to explore the data from the [World Happiness Reports 2012-2025](https://worldhappiness.report/analysis/) using the R
language.

I am writing this book as a text for others to read because that forces
me to become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more
carefully.

Please keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a
learner.

## Glossary {.unnumbered}

I am using the [glossary package](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/) to create links to glossary
entries.

::: my-r-code
::: my-r-code-header
::: {#cnj-load-glossary}
: Load glossary
:::

::: my-r-code-container
```{r}
#| label: load-glossary
#| lst-label: lst-preface-load-glossary
#| lst-cap: "Install and load the glossary package with the appropriate glossary.yml file"


## 1. Install the glossary package:
## https://debruine.github.io/glossary/

library(glossary)

## If you want to use my glossary.yml file:

## 1. fork my repo
##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb

## 2. Download the `glossary.yml` file from
##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml)

## 3. Store the file on your hard disk
##    and change the following path accordingly

glossary::glossary_path("../glossary-pb/glossary.yml")

```
:::
:::

If you hover with your mouse over the double underlined links it opens
an window with the appropriate glossary text. Try this example:
`r glossary("WHR")`.

To apply the glossary into this text I have used the {**glossary**}
package by [Lisa
DeBruine](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/index.html).

There is no guarantee that the glossary text -- as well as
the whole book -- contains correct information. Whenever possible I have
mentioned the source of the glossary entry. (You will find active
links to the source in the original glossary file at
[GitHub](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml))<br /><br />
Sometimes I have used abbreviation for the source, but I need
still to provide a key what this short references mean.

If you fork the [repository of this quarto
book](https://github.com/petzi53/world-happiness-report) then the glossary
will not work out of the box. Load down the `glossary.yml` file from [my
glossary-pb GitHub
repo](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml),
store it on your hard disk and change the path in the code chunk
@lst-preface-load-glossary.

In any case I am the only responsible person for this text.

## R Code {.unnumbered}

For R code I am using mainly the [Tidyverse Style
Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) with some additions from [Googleâ€™s
R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html). These
additons are:

-   Start the names of private functions with a dot.
-   Don't use `base::attach()`.
-   No right-hand assignments.
-   Qualify namespace.

Especially the last point (qualifying namespace) is important for my
learning. Besides preventing conflicts with functions of identical names
from different packages it helps me to learn (or remember) which
function belongs to which package. I think this justifies the small
overhead and helps to make R code chunks self-sufficient. (No previous
package loading, or library calls in the setup chunk.) To foster
learning the relation between function and package I embrace the package
name with curly brakes and format it in bold. Additionally I will add a
special annex file "Used packages" with an alphabetically sorted list of
short package descriptions.

I am mentioning package names explicitly also for the default
installation of base R. This wouldn't be necessary but it helps me to
understand where the base R functions come from. What follows is a list
of base R packages of the system library included into every
installation and attached (opened) by default:

-   {**base**}: The R Base Package
-   {**datsets**}: The R Datasets Package
-   {**graphics**}: The R Graphics Package
-   {**grDevices**}: The R Graphics Devices and Support for Colours and
    Fonts
-   {**methods**}: Formal Methods and Classes
-   {**stats**}: The R Stats Package
-   {**utils**}: The R Utils Package

But I will not always mention the name of the argument inside a
function. When it is clear then I will follow the advice from Hadley
Wickham: 

> When you call a function, you typically omit the names of data arguments, because they are used so commonly. If you overridethe default value of an argument, use the full name ([tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html)).
